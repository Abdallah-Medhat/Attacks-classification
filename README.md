# Attacks-classification
Attacks classification by some algorithms of machine learning to use in any firewall to protect any website from attacks .
the dataset is taken form https://github.com/grananqvist/Machine-Learning-Web-Application-Firewall-and-Dataset/tree/master/data (payloads.csv) .
After Buliding Model ,deploy the model in firewall to stop attack occur in any website. 
Requrment to Buliding Model : 
studied python 
studeied some libraries in python ex numpy , pands , sklearn and matplotlib
studied the basis of machine leaening and algorithms of machine learning
